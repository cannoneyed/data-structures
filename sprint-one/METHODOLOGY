How tests were conducted:

We 4 HTML files, one for each type of instantiation. Each links to a different JS file defining each constructor function.

All 4 link to profiler.js. That file sets a timer, creates $tests number of instantiations, stops the timer, then prints out results.

We load up each html test file in browser, clear the console, and refresh the page 10 times (with persistent console log turned on) to collect data.

All raw data is copied into RESULTS-DATA file. Then organized into Google Spreadsheet (using the FANTASTIC Sublime multi-cursor).
